This package provides a ROS driver for Infinisoleil sensors. The driver
accesses the sensors using the infinisoleil-lib.

The driver publishes range and IR images and point cloud. The driver
converts from received packets containing range and IR data into
sensor_msgs/Image respectively. In addition, the driver creates
sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 by using obtained range data and sensor
information.
